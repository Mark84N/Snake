# Snake-
Plain console snake game
Maybe not the best, but nice-working example of plain console Snake on C++ :D 
User moves snake by arrow keys, there are few features as increasing snake's size by collecting hearts, 
and also changing of speed depending on gained points. Aw, you also shouldn't touch ur body with the head!)
